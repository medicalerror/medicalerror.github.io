If you would like to know the medications that worsen a little bit my mitral valve prolapse, considered reading my previous story.</p><p>When there&#x27;s a time I need to go back to cardiologist Gerry C. Tan because of the pains on both sides of my lower chest, mostly the right side, the doctor says it’s abdomen and request a whole abdomen ultrasound with a prescription. <i>(I soon then remember that I drink pineapple juice around 11PM, I knew my acid tolerance isn&#x27;t that weak and might become weak by my recent medications.)</i> After a few days, I saw blood in my stool and make a call to schedule for an ultrasound, I now believed that it&#x27;s caused by my recent problem with hemorrhoids.</p><img title="pantopraz-and-gaviscon-prescription-11-23-2018" src="//images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/4VfMsjzErk50FpVr1mvHt2/f905b0dfc0227c72026e8b83ebb618f0/pantopraz-and-gaviscon-prescription-11-23-2018.jpg" class="jsx-3687481960"/><ul><li><p>I have fasted 8 hours and talked to the clerk receptionist and radiologic technologist Jonah B.

After that, the staff required me to eat and drink a lot of water without urinating and go back if I feel that I really need to pee.</p></li><li><p>After eating, drinking 500mL of water and going back, she ask me to drink another 500mL and it looks like she&#x27;s prioritizing the doctor.</p></li><li><p>When I tell to her that I feel that I really need to pee, she just replied that there&#x27;s still a patient pointing to the patient laying in a hospital bed on the front of their 1st ultrasound table even though the 2nd table is free. I don&#x27;t know if she is just being lazy or the scheduled radiologist Ronald G. Yebes wasn&#x27;t there, she really doesn&#x27;t care whatever happened to their patients.</p></li><li><p>Until it reach to the point that I&#x27;m overly exceedingly and brutality avoiding to pee. When I can&#x27;t really take the pain, she used their 2nd table, same where my 1st scan have taken. But it still takes another 5-10 mins because after she scan my bladder, the radiologist Ronald G. Yebes was also not there, making me cry waiting for him saying <i>&quot;Ma&#x27;am, can we cancel this?&quot;</i> while she&#x27;s calling him, no other staff came to me. They don&#x27;t really know what to do, why the other staff didn&#x27;t call the radiologist while the radiologic technologist was still scanning me?</p></li><li><p>After the scan, radiologist Ronald G. Yebes loudly says &quot;Go pee, pee all.&quot; I attempted to rush, Jonah B. Ybañez asks <i>&quot;Why?&quot;</i> and I go to their comport room. While urinating, most of my urine didn&#x27;t came out that time.</p></li><li><p>When I came back, Jonah scans me again. She looks shocked, asking <i>&quot;Did you urinate them all?&quot;</i> I replied <i>&quot;Not all came out, maybe later.&quot;</i> Then she asked the doctor if he needs to check me again, the doctor declined.</p></li></ul><img title="jonah-ybanez Jd-SKiQoNPI" src="//images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/74klPdz1sm66NqQiuqSHAv/1639d650377d16ae996d3e472284eca2/jonah-ybanez_Jd-SKiQoNPI.jpg" class="jsx-3687481960"/><img title="ron-yebes-10156350842933600" src="//images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/7zU9UNdL0bSCQdIEBb82bo/09a4c182ead183bb07134654ded74b30/ron-yebes-10156350842933600.jpg" class="jsx-3687481960"/><p>Even uneducated people knew how dangerous and risky is that kind of malpractice.

I tell him about my rectal bleeding. He requested a stool test, occult blood and fecalysis calmly saying <i>&quot;You need to show a proof&quot;</i>.</p><p>I processed and got my 1st stool test result for occult blood and fecalysis around between November and December, and show it to him. He said that the result was okay and ask me to just take a medicine.</p><img title="pantopraz-prescription-12-07-2018" src="//images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/6BUx6qVV22StfCK0j0GZB5/d779d332babcfaa91f1f4229798c2e8c/pantopraz-prescription-12-07-2018.jpg" class="jsx-3687481960"/><p>But I had to consult back again because of another blood occurrence on my stool, he requested for another occult blood and fecalysis. This time, I waited for the occurrence to test, and the second result shows that it was positive. <i>(I now believed that it&#x27;s related to my problem with hemorrhoids.)</i> He ask me if I want to proceed with endoscopy, I refused. Then he ask if I want to redo the ultrasound just to be sure, I also refuse telling the result might be the same. Then he just ask me if I&#x27;m eating properly. I also mentioned him the pains on the very sides of my chest. At first he prescribe me 100 pieces of Norgesic Forte, 2 tablets per day, I ask him <i>&quot;Do I need to take them all?&quot;</i> He replied <i>&quot;No, oh well.&quot;</i> and revised the number of pieces from 100 to 20.</p><img title="occult-blood-positive-12-13-2018" src="//images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/5W4uR02TggkUOUqCq8o11m/21ad33c0d6943c33b2afa9c4b2a8da0c/occult-blood-positive-12-13-2018.jpg" class="jsx-3687481960"/><img title="norgesic-forte-prescription-12-13-2018" src="//images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/1A0xRSfwCC1O9pm2H7hyqn/d864c5a75f312a1ef20d6ecf39280e29/norgesic-forte-prescription-12-13-2018.jpg" class="jsx-3687481960"/><p>At first taking it, I felt some lower left abdominal aches <i>(the first time I feel lower abdominal ache upon taking medicine)</i>.

Norgesic Forte Tab was replaced by Neurobion Forte <i>(vitamin B complex)</i>.

Melendres because I know that my lower left abdominal aches needs to be checked. I showed her my 1st whole abdomen ultrasound result and told her about the ultrasound procedure issue. She told me that it&#x27;s okay and said that <b>&quot;Your kidney just have a little water in it.&quot;</b> and just asked <i>&quot;Like there&#x27;s urine left inside after you pee?&quot;</i> She also said these about the aches <i>&quot;It might be an air/gas on your abdomen? Is the aches moving around your abdomen?&quot;</i> Then she told me to just continue taking Pantoprazole and requested a urinalysis and occult blood &amp; fecalysis. I returned with all good results but comeback again and she re-requested for another occult blood and fecalysis, return back and mentioned her some sort of my chest pain. She just ended up referring me to gastroenterologist with prescription mistake, had a bad experience on that day because her assistant start fighting the old doctor when it&#x27;s my turn to be checked. I didn&#x27;t take any of the prescribed medicines, but I guess, that resulted me to overthink making me dizzy, not sure if that&#x27;s exactly the cause.</p><p>I then go to internist-cardiology Albert S. Ang for that dizziness and desperately showcase him everything about my medical history. He checked me with their E.C.G. and prescribed me an anti-vertigo medication. He told that <b>&quot;It&#x27;s not good to take medicine, especially if you don&#x27;t have a disease&quot;</b> and mentions to consult a psychiatrist before going back. Upon taking Betahistine, a little ache on my lower left abdomen occurs again, I just stop taking it after taking the 2nd tablet, I guess.</p><img title="betahistine-prescription-01-20-2019" src="//images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/7cz896WU7QfbMFXgIvWmdO/42be87119964d292fc3003edbad9642c/betahistine-prescription-01-20-2019.jpg" class="jsx-3687481960"/><p>After a few days, I go back to Albert S. Ang again complaining the little left area numbness of my back, he prescribed me Celebrex <i>(celecoxib)</i> 200mg a day, telling <b>to stop that medication right away once the pain goes away</b> and if I experience some lower left abdomen ache by taking it, consult a psychiatrist before going back.</p><img title="celecoxib-prescription-05-21-2019" src="//images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/4QljzCBtVAzDpMma09yv7Z/09e46ad627d029de59343ae93c59739b/celecoxib-prescription-05-21-2019.jpg" class="jsx-3687481960"/><p>A month ago, I experienced some uncomfortable feelings on my neck like it&#x27;s being taped making me to self-medicate and take Neurobion Forte for a relieve. When I&#x27;m on the time range of taking the 5th to 8th tablet, I experience a lower left abdomen ache again, just ignoring it believing it was just a gas on my lower abdomen, then after a day, I experience a lower back pain, and some very little numbness on the metatarsal of my fourth toe.</p><p>I plan to consult back to Gerry C. Tan but ended up to a family physician Maria Victoria D. Marbibi, showing all my medical test results. She mentioned to repeat my MRI and ultrasound tests. At the end, she told me before she prescribe me Pantoprazole + Domperidone and 7 pieces of Myonal tab 50mg, 1 tablet a day, <b>to never take a medicine without the prescription of a doctor because of my kidney</b>. Unfortunately, a single Pantoprazole + Domperidone gave me nervousness then after a day a heart palpitation.</p><img title="pantoprazole-domperidone-and-myonal-prescription-2019" src="//images.ctfassets.net/gdquurxkfsex/4KcAgelaBN8c1PT0aLvfsG/d95d775e1e11fac30e5d7173cd1a5e82/pantoprazole-domperidone-and-myonal-prescription-2019.jpg" class="jsx-3687481960"/><p>I go to back to cardiologist Gerry C. Tan and tell him a story about my previous issue. He just interrupted me and requested me a holter monitor test. I just start taking Myonal after showing him Dr. Marbibi&#x27;s prescription.</p><p>[Holter monitoring test]</p><p>While I&#x27;m taking Myonal and wearing Holter monitor, my right back pain then later right chest pain occurs. I go back to him with the result, and Pantopraz and Arcoxia have been prescribed to me by cardiologist Gerry C. Tan even though I said <b>&quot;But doc, not a medicine that will make the lower left of my abdomen hurt.&quot;</b> because that&#x27;s keep happening when I&#x27;m taking something, he knows that. He seems not to worry at all telling me to <i>&quot;Just not to think too much.&quot;</i></p><p>[Pantopraz and Arcoxia]</p><blockquote><p>If Norgestic Forte could give me lower left abdomen ache, what more can the newly prescribed painkiller give, as it&#x27;s more stronger than Norgestic Forte. Why did the cardiologist Gerry C. Tan prescribed me Pantopraz 40mg for 30 days and Arcoxia 90mg for 10 days, including my maintenance Propranolol 10mg a day? I don&#x27;t know, but if I were a doctor, I think that painkiller couldn&#x27;t be given to someone with lower left abdomen pain when taking medicine without proper diagnostic? Sadly, too late to be know..</p></blockquote><ol><li><p>After taking those, I experience a little of lower left abdomen ache, thinking that it&#x27;s just a gas on my abdomen because I&#x27;m sometimes farting.</p></li><li><p>On the fourth day of <b>taking medications as prescribed by cardiologist Gerry C. Tan, after my breakfast and taking Propranolol and Pantopraz, I experience pain on the center top of abdomen and not feeling well, and think if I&#x27;ll still take Arcoxia. After 4–5 hours, the lower left of my abdomen is very hurt, making my walk limping</b> and decided not to take Arcoxia. The lower left of my abdomen is not feeling well for about two days.</p></li><li><p>After two days, I go back to cardiologist Gerry C. Tan and he requested another whole abdomen ultrasound and replied me to continue Pantopraz.</p><ul><li><p>I came to the ultrasound room of San Juan de Dios Hospital (Pasay) fasted 8 hours, early in the morning. Jonalyn B. Glima is the assigned radiologic technologist this time. She allow me to pee.</p></li><li><p>When I&#x27;m now on their 2nd ultrasound table lying down, she ask me if I have a record on them, I replied yes and she ask when, then she check my record before proceeding the 1st scan.</p></li><li><p>After the first scan, she ask me just to sit while laying on their table, and ask me to drink, then I ask how many, she just replied <i>&quot;Just the amount that you can&quot;</i> and said <i>&quot;Let&#x27;s just wait here.&quot;</i> We just waited for a couple of seconds, then the doctor start to scan my gallbladder but it&#x27;s still not full, then they allow me to leave and come back when I feel that I need to pee.</p></li><li><p>I drink all that I can but not as many as the amount that I drank on my first ultrasound procedure. And after I go back, it&#x27;s much like the 2nd ultrasound procedure might end up like the previous one, I just learn how to complain and also the doctor was there.</p><ul><li><p>I saw some patients that are holding their urine too long. The 1st one is asking to be their turn while holding his urine, the staff is just saying there&#x27;s still a patient inside.</p></li><li><p>The 2nd person that I saw is running to their comport room after the scan. This kind of medical malpractice should be stopped. I hope that I&#x27;m their last patient to develop a serious disease with their malpractice procedure.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The result shows that I now have an <b><i>&quot;ECHOGENIC RENAL PARENCHYMA, CONSIDERED BILATERAL RENAL PARENCHYMAL DISEASE&quot;</i></b>.</p></li><li><p>Upon going back to Dr. Gerry C. Tan the one who take for granted the situation of my left lower abdomen, this malpractitioner told me that there&#x27;s no medication for my kidney damage, just told me that the treatment for this are to reduce my salty and oily intakes and re-scan my kidney every after 6 months.</p><ul><li><p>He ask me if I want to proceed a 2D echo and he acted like he&#x27;s scanning his left kidney. I said <i>&quot;No, I don&#x27;t have money&quot;</i>, he just replied <i>&quot;Hehe&quot;</i>.</p></li><li><p>He then referred me to a nephrology. I then go back after a day, to get a charity letter for a nephrology from him, he just gave me a referral for their out patient.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>After this disaster, I&#x27;m feeling so fatigue and really trying to force myself to get up for about a few days, I guess that was my body response on the medical harm caused by taking Pantopraz and Arcoxia.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>After going to their outpatient and talking to their staff, he referred me to their surgery. After a lot of processes, the surgery doctor, just referred to their medicine. After a day and another processes, their medicine doctor request me some lab tests and ABG.</p><p>[LAB TESTS]</p><p>[ABG]</p><p>Upon my follow-up with a different medicine doctor, we talk and I just ended up being suggesting to make a follow-up checkup within 1 year.</p><p>On August 31 to September 1 2019. I&#x27;m the only one who catch cold and is not feeling well, and like it&#x27;s impossible for me to buy my night dinner of August 31, it&#x27;s very cold to the bone.</p><p></p><p></p><ol><li><p>It pretty seems that the ultrasound service&#x27; staffs of San Juan de Dios Hospital <i>(Pasay)</i> have a habit of making their peeing patients ignored whatever then wanted. The malpractitioner radiologic technologist Jonah B. Ybañez just making it to the next level by requiring to their patients to drink a lot of water making their radiologist values ahead of their patients. I don&#x27;t how did she ignore me after I come back peeing and have drank 1 litter of water.
[Jonah]</p></li><li><p>It could be because their malpractitioner radiologist Ronald G. Yebes wasn&#x27;t there? That radiologist can do whatever he wants to do, even leaving his enqueued patients or to come late? I don&#x27;t know if he still have care for his patients.
[Ronald]</p></li><li><p>And because of the arrogance and easy-to-be-annoyed attitude of malpractitioner cardiologist Gerry C. Tan, he&#x27;s carelessly prescribing his patients without taking care of their situations, even taking for granted what other doctor&#x27;s saying and what his patient&#x27;s saying. He have a record of multiple mistakes, see my Norgestic Forte prescription, it was originally written to have 100 tablets but overwritten when I says that <i>&quot;Do I need to take them all?&quot;</i>
[TAN]</p></li></ol><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>What a horrible patient experience. If San Juan de Dios Hospital <i>(Pasay)</i> doesn&#x27;t have a medical malpractice whole abdomen ultrasound service and.their doctor didn&#x27;t prescribe me high dosage of medications without proper evaluation why the center-left side of my lower abdomen is aching when taking pain reliever, this would never happen!</p><p></p><p>I guess, I must not be too fearful on any pain that I can endure because painkiller would result to a more serious condition that will soon to come… Or it’s just a cause of careless medication? Read my next story to know more.</p><p>No matter how careful you are in your life, whatever hard work do you do to have a better future, as long as these malpractitioners, the appointed staff and the doctor on my 1st San Juan de Dios Hospital <i>(Pasay)</i> ultrasound, cardiologist Gerry C. Tan and the one who teaches and allowed that appointed staff to perform an ultrasound scan, are undisabled, they might ruined other patient life.</p><hr class="jsx-2422333697"/></div><div class="jsx-2745431905 share-buttons"><p class="jsx-2745431905">Please share for other people&#x27;s awareness</p><div class="jsx-2745431905 addthis_inline_share_toolbox"></div></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></div></div><div class="jsx-2223359152 footer"><div class="jsx-2223359152"><p class="jsx-2223359152">If I only have an opportunity, I would give those greedy and careless malpractitioners some lessons.<br class="jsx-2223359152"/>2019</p></div><div class="jsx-2223359152"><ul class="jsx-2223359152"><li class="jsx-2223359152">Philippine Daily Inquirer<!-- --> –<!-- --> <a href="http://inquirer.net/" target="_blank" class="jsx-2223359152">http://inquirer.net/</a></li><li class="jsx-2223359152">Philippine Star<!-- --> –<!-- --> <a href="http://philstar.com/" target="_blank" class="jsx-2223359152">http://philstar.com/</a></li><li class="jsx-2223359152">Manila Bulletin<!-- --> –<!-- --> <a href="https://mb.com.ph/" target="_blank" class="jsx-2223359152">https://mb.com.ph/</a></li><li class="jsx-2223359152">The Manila Times<!-- --> –<!-- --> <a href="http://www.manilatimes.net/news/" target="_blank" class="jsx-2223359152">http://www.manilatimes.net/news/</a></li><li class="jsx-2223359152">Manila Standard<!-- --> –<!-- --> <a href="http://manilastandard.net/" target="_blank" class="jsx-2223359152">http://manilastandard.net/</a></li><li class="jsx-2223359152">BusinessWorld<!-- --> –<!-- --> <a href="http://bworldonline.com/" target="_blank" class="jsx-2223359152">http://bworldonline.com/</a></li><li class="jsx-2223359152">Business Mirror<!-- --> –<!-- --> <a href="https://businessmirror.com.ph/" target="_blank" class="jsx-2223359152">https://businessmirror.com.ph/</a></li><li class="jsx-2223359152">The Daily Tribune<!-- --> –<!-- --> <a href="http://www.tribune.net.ph/" target="_blank" class="jsx-2223359152">http://www.tribune.net.ph/</a></li><li class="jsx-2223359152">Malaya<!-- --> –<!-- --> <a href="http://www.malaya.com.ph/" target="_blank" class="jsx-2223359152">http://www.malaya.com.ph/</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"dataManager":"[]","props":{"pageProps":{"item":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"gdquurxkfsex"}},"id":"5964r1HMWpXbhiWZQHLazs","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-11-11T14:47:19.127Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-15T19:08:18.846Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":20,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"medicalMalpracticePost"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"How an abdomen ultrasound procedure, Pantoprazole and painkillers damage my kidneys","slug":"how-abdomen-ultrasound-procedure-pantoprazole-and-painkillers-damage-my-kidneys","body":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"I'm Mark Anthony B.
